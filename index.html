            <h3>Why Goleniów?</h3>
            <h2>Goleniów the city of defensive walls</h2>
            <p>
              The settlement dates back to the 10th century. Together with
              Pomerania it formed part of medieval Poland until 1138 and as a
              result of the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland it became part
              of the separate Duchy of Pomerania, ruled by the House of Griffin.
              Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania granted the settlement Magdeburg town
              rights and additional privileges in 1264, yet Gollnow was
              rechartered with Lübeck Law, which favoured the local merchants,
              in 1314.The town grew by exploiting the vast timber reserves in
              the town-owned forests, and by trade.
            </p>
            <p>
              The town was connected to the Baltic Sea trade routes by the port
              of Ihnamünde at the mouth of the Ina river. Competition with
              nearby Stettin (Szczecin) led to a series of conflicts between the
              two towns, the differences were set aside only in 1615 when the
              towns signed a reconciling treaty. The town remained part of the
              Duchy of Pomerania until Sweden took over in 1630.

              <h3>Medieval defensive walls</h3>
              <p>
                Stone and brick, several fragments, the most beautiful is on the
                river. In another, there are the cylindrical Powder Tower and
                the octagonal Mint Tower, where coins were minted, next to it
                there is a water gate, the second fragment next to the Wolinska
                Gate (an octagonal turret with the city's coats of arms) and in
                the Goleniów Planty. The construction of the city's defensive
                fortifications began right after the city was founded (1268).
                Until the mid-fourteenth century, Goleniów was surrounded by a
                stone and stone and brick wall with several lookouts and towers.

              <h3>Old granary</h3>
              <p>
                Old granary on the river Ina (18th century), half-timbered, the
                only one that survived, high, three-storey, located on the site
                of the former river port, an interesting example of
                half-timbered architecture, currently not in use. In the 14th
                century, when the fishing settlement on the Ina River
                flourished, two granaries and port buildings were built. Thanks
                to belonging to the Hanseatic League from 1368. In the
                mid-sixteenth century, in place of two small granaries, a larger
                one was built. In 1749, it was demolished, and a new one was
                erected on its foundations, which has survived to our times.
